# LoL Characters and Statistics
- I made an application in the project that displays photos of characters from the League of Legends game and their statistics.
- In this project, since I couldn't find an API, I created the data myself and printed the information of the characters on the screen from there.
- The site I used for statistics `https://www.op.gg/statistics/champions?hl=en_US`
- The site I used for images and information `https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/`

## üîçUsage
- Enter the name of the character you want in the search button.
- You can view the statistics of the character you want by clicking on their respective card on the displayed screen.
